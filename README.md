# ActivityPub

A package for working with the [ActivityPub](https://activitypub.rocks/) protocol.

WIP: This is a bit of an experiment from me. I'm trying to see how easy i can make activitypub development

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `activity_pub` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:activity_pub, git: "https://github.com/benbot/activity_pub", branch: "master"}
  ]
end
```
